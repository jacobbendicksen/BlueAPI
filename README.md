BlueAPI
=======
This is a Python library in development by FRC Team 1540 to allow for easier access to The Blue Alliance's API by everyone, even beginner programmers.

Currently, it handles interfacing with the API itself, and returns dictionaries with all the data that the API returns. We're working on additional libraries to convert the dictionaries into human-readable text, so stay tuned for that.

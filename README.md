BlueAPI
=======
This is a Python library in development by FRC Team 1540 to allow for easier access to The Blue Alliance's API by everyone, even beginner programmers.

Currently, it handles interfacing with the API itself, and returns dictionaries with all the data that the API returns. We're working on additional libraries to convert the dictionaries into human-readable text, so stay tuned for that.

When you first download the blueapi.py library, please be sure to update the header information to accurately reflect you and/or your team. The Blue Alliance requires that all API users identify themselves in this way, so be sure to do that before beginning use.

This is still very much a work in progress (and my first stab at a large Python project), so don't judge me if something doesn't work or is poorly written. Instead, let me know, and I'll fix it!
